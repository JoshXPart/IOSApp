## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Reddit:
- Accessibility and Usability are friendly
- Very good recommendation algorithm

Retro Bowl:
- Simple but fun IOS game
- variety of mechanics to keep the game fun

Tiktok
- Ability to comment and interact with other users
- Great recommendation algorithm
- Easy UI

I would like to create a retro dungeon crawler app. I think using graphics like Retro Bowl would be fun and easy and then I would implement mechanics from classic dungeon crawlers like Binding of isaac. I would want to have proceduaral dungeons and items generated. I would also include some way for players to interat with others, maybe a daily scoreboard run, or a level builder system where levels can be shared.
